Lending
================================

You can check the available books or material online with your account.

To lend any books or material you visit the library and search for the item you want to lend.
The location can be found in ILMO.

An administrator will then check the code of the item. You will provide them with the user ID you
got during the registration or your E-Mail Address. The item will then be marked as lent.

You have to return the item according to the rules of the library.
