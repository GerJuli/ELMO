Lending
=======

As a user wants to lend an item you need to know the following:
   - Item category [book or material]
   - Item ID [e.g. ``CH42 d``]
   - User ID or e-mail address

As many users do not remember their user ID or which e-mail address they used there is the
possibility to search for a user. Select :guilabel:`Search user` from the navigation and  
search e.g. for their forename and then use the found information to continue the lending.
